Open Context Protocol (OCP) is an open standard for turning web APIs into agent tools. It’s built for agent/tooling folks who want reliable tool discovery, and for API builders who want their APIs to be usable by agents without inventing a new integration surface.

MCP is a strong model for applications. OCP is the web-native lane for APIs. It starts from what already exists — OpenAPI — and defines a consistent way for agents to discover operations and call them as tools.

OCP is built with a minimal-footprint mindset. It’s designed to work with existing APIs out of the box, and to scale up when you want richer, context-aware workflows. Alongside the spec, there’s a public registry of pre-indexed APIs, client libraries, and a VS Code extension to drop OCP into real agent workflows.
